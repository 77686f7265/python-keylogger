# python-keylogger

This tool requires python 2 installed on your computer. It's python keylogger that records all the keystrokes and saves them to a txt file. AND THEN uploads the said txt file to a FTP server. I'm not responsible for what you do with this, remember that, if you do evil with this key-logger, it's illegal.

## Compatibility

For now, it only works on linux and mac(I think). I'll port it to windows later on.
